All notable changes to Peckish. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
versions follow semver (0.x: minor = features, patch = fixes). Each release on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CydVilla/peckish/releases) carries this
file's section for that version, every downloadable artifact, and a
`SHA256SUMS.txt` to verify them.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed
- **`submit_order` could never confirm an order it had just placed.** The poll
  read `final_status.status`, but dd-cli nests the order under `result` — there
  is no top-level `status`, and the pre-0.2.3 value `successful` the note and
  tool description told the model to look for no longer exists at all. So the
  loop never saw a non-`pending` value: it burned all 8 attempts (40 seconds) on
  every submit and then handed the model a contract it could not satisfy. Status
  now comes from `result.status` through a derived `lifecycle` block
  (`order_created`, `is_terminal`, `keep_polling`, `not_found`), and the poll
  exits on the first conclusive check. Cart cleanup no longer depends on a
  string comparison that always failed through to `submitRes.success`.
- **Order history rows came back undated.** The mapper read `created_at`, which
  dd-cli does not return; the real fields are `order_date` and
  `order_fulfilled_at`. Item `item_id` was dropped too. Rows carry no total and
  no per-item price on 0.2.5, so the tool description stops promising them and
  points at `get_receipt` instead.
- **Peckish told the model "no popularity data exists" while discarding it.**
  Menu items carry `is_popular`, `popularity_rank` and `popular_modifications`.
  The tokens now carry them through and the instruction says to use them.
- **Verified against a real dd-cli 0.2.5, and two menu fields were being
  dropped.** The 0.2.3–0.2.5 catch-up was written from release notes, which
  name features but not response fields; `menu --help` on the real binary names
  them. Two fell through both the explicit trimmer picks and
  `CARRY_THROUGH_TOKENS`:
  - `items[].orderability` (the per-item `asap` / `schedule_ahead` list) — no
    token matched it, so the model never saw it *while `get_menu`'s own
    description promised it was there*. Added as its own token.
  - `store_next_open_time` — now picked explicitly next to `store_is_open`,
    rather than widening the token set with "open"/"time" and dragging
    unrelated timestamps through every menu.

  Both were then confirmed present in live responses, along with every flag:
  `verify-dd-cli.mjs` reports 17 passed, 0 failed against a signed-in 0.2.5.
  `promotions[]` and `applicable_promotion_ids` are matched by the existing
  tokens, the 0.2.5 pickup fields were already allowlisted by name, and
  `findGuestToken()` searches by key name rather than path — 0.2.5 confirms the
  key is exactly `guest_token` on the acted-for subcart.
- `tests/fixtures/fake-dd-cli.mjs` now mirrors real observed responses: the
  `order status` envelope nested under `result`, ISO `order_date` /
  `order_fulfilled_at` on history rows, and item popularity. Its invented flat
  `{status: "successful"}` is why the broken poll passed tests for so long.
  `submit_order` had no test coverage at all and now does.
- The fixture also uses the field names the real CLI documents (`applicable_promotion_ids`, `orderability`, `supports_order_ahead`,
  `promotions[].code`) instead of invented ones. The invented names happened to
  match the token set, which is why the suite stayed green while `orderability`
  was being dropped.

### Added
- **Guest sub-carts.** A group cart can now hold items for people with no
  DoorDash account: `add_items_to_cart` takes `guest_first_name` +
  `guest_last_name` and puts that person's items in their own sub-cart of a
  group cart the signed-in user hosts. `list_cart_guests` shows who is being
  tracked. This was the last substantial dd-cli capability Peckish did not
  reach — it is what lets one person with the CLI order for a team where
  nobody else has an account.
  - **The per-guest token never reaches the model.** DoorDash returns a
    `guest_token` on a guest's first add; it is a bearer credential for their
    sub-cart, appears exactly once (`cart show` never echoes it, nothing can
    fetch it again), and dd-cli's guidance is to keep it out of logs and away
    from humans. Peckish stores it in `~/.peckish/guests.json` (mode `0600`)
    keyed by cart and guest name, and `guest_token` is now stripped from every
    tool result — so it also never lands in the session audit log, which
    previews every result. The model refers to guests by name only and has no
    way to read or supply a token.
  - Peckish enforces dd-cli's constraints itself rather than letting a bad
    call fail downstream: a guest add needs an existing cart, cannot carry
    `group_cart`/`spend_limit_cents`, needs both halves of the name, and never
    sends a name alongside a token.
  - A cart's guests are dropped when its order is submitted or the cart is
    deleted; entries older than 30 days are pruned on write.
- **Joining a group cart now uses its link.** `add_items_to_cart` takes
  `group_cart_url`, which is how dd-cli actually joins another person's group
  cart — the previous guidance (their `cart_uuid` plus `group_cart`) described
  creating a cart, not joining one.
- Both system prompts now spell out that cart adds are **additive, not
  idempotent**: after a timeout or error, check `item_errors[]` before
  retrying, because an item missing from that list already went in and a retry
  doubles it.

### Added
- **End-to-end tests for the dd-cli command line Peckish builds.** A fake
  dd-cli (`tests/fixtures/fake-dd-cli.mjs`) records the argv each handler
  produces and answers with realistic envelopes, so the tests assert what
  Peckish actually sends — that `--address-id` replaces `--lat/--lng` on a
  0.2.4+ binary and not before, that `--price-tier` repeats per tier, that an
  unsupported command is never attempted, that decimal weights and
  `default_handling` survive serialization, and that every consumer command
  still carries `--json-output` and `--intent`. It cannot confirm dd-cli's
  real flag names — only a live binary can — but it covers the half Peckish
  owns. 19 new cases; the suite is 56.
- **`scripts/verify-dd-cli.mjs`** — run Peckish's assumptions against a real,
  signed-in dd-cli. Read-only (no carts, addresses, promos or orders): it
  reports which flags the installed binary accepts and prints the field names
  the responses actually carry, so the promo/order-ahead/weight key patterns
  in `src/tools.ts` can be replaced with certainty.
- **`docs/dd-cli-verification.md`** — the checklist for acting on what
  `verify-dd-cli.mjs` reports: which flag names to correct and where, how to
  reconcile the real response field names against the trimmers' token set, and
  which two write paths stay unexercised without explicit consent.
- **`scripts/check-dd-cli-release.mjs` and a weekly release-watch workflow.**
  Peckish sat three dd-cli releases behind before anyone noticed; this checks
  the published releases against `DD_CLI_RECOMMENDED_VERSION` every Monday and
  files an issue when a newer one is out.

### Fixed
- The age-restriction path is now named rather than implied: both system
  prompts call out `error_reason AGENTIC_RESTRICTED_ITEM_NOT_ALLOWED` on
  `submit_order` as the signal to hand over `get_checkout_url` instead of
  retrying the submit.

### Added
- **dd-cli 0.2.3–0.2.5 support.** Peckish had been built against dd-cli 0.2.2;
  three releases of new surface went unused. Now wired through:
  - **Address lookup** (dd-cli 0.2.3): `find_address` resolves a typed address
    to candidates and `add_address` saves the chosen one. Saving also makes it
    the account-wide default, so it sits behind the same approval prompt as
    `set_default_address`.
  - **Group orders in history** (0.2.3): `get_order_history` takes
    `include_group_order`, and group fields survive the response trim — team
    and office orders were invisible before.
  - **Full order lifecycle** (0.2.3): `get_order_status` now documents what it
    actually returns — placement and delivery progress, current ETA, late
    trend, actual delivery time, cancellation reason — so "where's my food?"
    is answered from the CLI rather than inferred from the submit response.
  - **Promo-aware menus** (0.2.4): `get_menu` and `get_restaurant_item_details`
    pass `--address-id`, so the store's active promotions and the items that
    qualify come back priced against the right delivery location.
  - **Search from a saved address** (0.2.4): `search_restaurants` and
    `find_stores` take `address_id`. Searching by coordinates alone dropped
    the promo context; the saved address id is now preferred whenever the
    installed dd-cli supports it.
  - **Search filters** (0.2.5): `dashpass_only`, `price_tier`,
    `distance_preference` and `max_eta_minutes` narrow server-side instead of
    over-fetching and filtering in the prompt.
  - **Pickup availability and schedule-ahead** (0.2.5): search results carry
    `offers_pickup`, `asap_pickup_availability`,
    `scheduled_pickup_availability` and `next_open_time_asap_pickup_ms`, and
    order-ahead windows now reach the model — a store that is closed now gets
    offered as a scheduled order instead of being dropped.
  - **Weight-priced items and merchant defaults** (0.2.5): cart items take a
    decimal `quantity` with a `unit`, and `default_handling: "exact"` opts out
    of a merchant's default modifications. The strict tool schemas had made
    both literally inexpressible.
- **dd-cli version detection.** Peckish probes `dd-cli --version` once per
  process, reports it in the session context, and gates the behaviours it
  applies automatically (like pricing menus against your saved address) on a
  confirmed version — so a newer Peckish keeps working on an older binary
  instead of failing on an unknown flag. Flags asked for explicitly are still
  passed through, so dd-cli's own error names the flag.
- **Response fields added after this code was written now survive the trim.**
  The menu/search trimmers were strict allowlists, which silently swallowed
  every field dd-cli added; keys naming a promotion, discount, order-ahead
  window or weight/unit now ride along.
- **Linux (x86_64) support**, following dd-cli v0.2.2's Linux builds. The
  terminal, web and MCP surfaces all run on Linux — same tools, same order
  gate, same audit log. dd-cli is discovered at `~/.local/bin/dd-cli`,
  `/usr/local/bin/dd-cli`, `DD_CLI_PATH`, or `PATH`. (The `.dmg` remains the
  one Mac-only surface.)
- **Browserless sign-in** for containers, VMs and cloud sandboxes: where
  `dd-cli login` can't complete, Peckish stops offering it — no spawned login
  that hangs, no advice that can't work — and tells you to mint a token with
  `dd-cli export-token` on a machine with a browser and pass it in as
  `DD_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The agent gets the same guidance on every surface, and
  a set-but-rejected token is reported as stale rather than missing.
- Unsupported platforms (Intel Macs, Linux arm64) now say so — "no dd-cli
  build" — instead of failing with an obscure missing-binary error.
- **Sign-in assist**: when DoorDash sign-in is missing or expired, Peckish now
  offers to fix it instead of sending you to a terminal. The terminal app asks
  before launching `dd-cli login` (which opens your browser) and waits for it;
  the web app serves a sign-in card instead of refusing to boot; and a new
  `start_signin` tool lets the agent offer the same assist mid-conversation on
  every surface — always behind an explicit approval prompt, and it never
  opens a second sign-in window while one is pending.

### Changed
- The Claude Desktop extension now declares `["darwin", "linux"]` compatibility
  (dd-cli ships builds for both), and its docs no longer claim a Mac is
  required.

### Fixed
- The extension manifest's version is now read from `extension/package.json`
  and its tool list from the repo's own build (previously a hardcoded version
  and the installed npm package could both drift).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-28

Compatibility release for **dd-cli v0.2.1** (required — older dd-cli versions
no longer work with Peckish 0.4.0, and vice versa). After upgrading dd-cli,
run `dd-cli login` again: new CLI versions can require fresh sign-in scopes.

### Added
- **Group carts**: "start a group order, $25 each" — creates a shareable cart
  link (`group_cart_url`), optional per-person spend limit, join someone
  else's cart by its id; the host previews and submits.
- **Priority (express) delivery**: request the paid faster option; Peckish
  verifies the cart actually offers it before promising, and carries the same
  choice through to submit so the charge matches the quote.
- **Credits control**: DoorDash credits apply by default; "don't use my
  credits" opts a single order out (preview and submit stay consistent).
- **Enterprise chains**: Domino's, Sweetgreen, Dave's Hot Chicken and other
  large chains are now orderable.
- Dockerfile for registry/CI introspection (the MCP server boots and lists
  its tools without dd-cli, which is only executed at tool-call time).

### Changed
- Every dd-cli call now carries the CLI's new required `--intent` note —
  with a **privacy-preserving default**: Peckish sends a generic goal summary
  and explicitly withholds your verbatim prompt unless you set
  `PECKISH_INTENT_VERBATIM=1`. See README → "What Peckish shares with
  DoorDash".
- Preview results now include the cart's delivery options (so express
  availability is visible to the agent).

### Fixed
- dd-cli v0.2.1's new authentication-failure message is recognized and
  surfaced as a clear "run `dd-cli login`" instruction instead of a generic
  error.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- Rotating suggestion prompts on the web app's start screen.

### Changed
- Coordinated version bump across all packages (`peckish`, `peckish-mcp`,
  desktop, extension) with dependency ranges moved to `^0.3.0`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- `peckish-mcp` npm package — one-line MCP install:
  `claude mcp add peckish -- npx -y peckish-mcp`.
- Listed in the official MCP Registry as `io.github.CydVilla/peckish`.
- Claude Desktop `.mcpb` bundle (double-click install) attached to releases.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Address switcher in the web app: click the address chip to change your
  default delivery address (text edits happen on doordash.com; Peckish picks
  them up automatically).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-21

First public release.

### Added
- Three surfaces over one tool layer: terminal chat (`peckish`), local web
  app (`peckish-web`), and MCP server for Claude Desktop / Claude Code.
- Full ordering flow on DoorDash's official dd-cli: search, menus and
  customizations, carts, real fee-included quotes, promos, reorders, order
  history and receipts, groceries/retail, work benefits, scheduled delivery.
- Safety model: placing an order always requires an explicit human approval
  rendered by the surface (typed `yes` / web modal / MCP elicitation dialog,
  fail closed); tip confirmed and payment card named before any submit ask;
  submissions never auto-retry; JSONL audit log of every tool call.
- Cost-lean defaults: claude-sonnet-5 at medium effort, prompt caching,
  per-session cost meter.
- Mac app (.dmg) with guided no-terminal setup.
